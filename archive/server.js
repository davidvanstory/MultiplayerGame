CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep it all in one HTML file.
- Add WebSocket connection code that connects to ws://localhost:3001.
- Implement proper player assignment: 1st browser = Player 1, 2nd browser = Player 2.
- Display "You are Player: X" prominently in each browser.
- Only allow the current player to take turns (disable button when not your turn).
- Show turn status: "ðŸŸ¢ It's YOUR turn!" vs "ðŸ”´ Wait for Player X's turn".
- Add comprehensive logging with player IDs: "[Player X] message".
- Handle server messages with this format: {currentPlayer: 1, counter: 0, target: 5, yourPlayerId: 1, type: 'gameState'}.
- Send moves as: {type: 'takeTurn'} to server.
- Style disabled buttons gray and enabled buttons green.
- No external dependencies.
- Make UI feedback very clear about whose turn it is.

SERVER PROTOCOL:
- Server assigns yourPlayerId on connection
- Server validates turns (rejects moves from wrong player)
- Server broadcasts updated gameState to all clients
- Server handles win conditions and game reset

Game HTML:
${gameHtml}`
